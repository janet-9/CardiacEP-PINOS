# CardiacEP-PINOS

Complementary Code and results for the work **"PHYSICS INFORMED NEURAL OPERATORS FOR CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY"**.  

This repository provides training and evaluation scripts for running a PINO based model for the simulation of cardiac electrophysiology propagation scenarios using the Aliev Panfilov (AP) Cell Model. We also provide the results of the experiments performed in this work, including animations of the model predictions.
